Overall Description
===================

POWER Engineers is sponsoring a senior design project at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville Computer Science department.  This is the git repository for the project.

Project Description
===================

Distributed Network Protocol (DNP) is a communication protocol that has found widespread deployment in the electric and water utilities. DNP is supported by many Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs), communications processors, Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), and master stations. Modbus is another communications protocol which is commonly found in electrical substations.

Troubleshooting efforts may involve interpreting the raw communications data stream and extracting the DNP or Modbus message.  POWER Engineers would like to automate that process using a software application.

POWER Engineers will provide test cases in electronic format to validate the application's operation.

An optional task for creating a server based application is included.

Task 1 Specifications
=====================

The goal of this project is to produce a software application that can read data, decode all DNP or Modbus messages in the data, and display those messages in a meaninful way.  Task 1 describes the specific requirements associated with this project.
